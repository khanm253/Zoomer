# Zoomer
### This app allows you to request rides - matching you with
drivers in the nearby area to safely take you to your destination.

### Created an application with a microservices architecture,
containing three microservices (backend Java APIs) with an accompanying API Gateway. Used PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Neo4J databases for the three microservices
respectively, and will be implemented this project using the Java Maven framework.
